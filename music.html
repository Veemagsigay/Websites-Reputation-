        <h1>Ready For it</h1>
        <p>
            Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him <br>
            Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted <br>
            But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom <br>
            Holdin' him for ransom, some <br>
            Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though <br>
            Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so <br>
            I see nothing better, I keep him forever <br>
            Like a vendetta-ta</p>

        <p>
            I, I, I see how this is gon' go<br>
            Touch me and you'll never be alone<br>
            I-Island breeze and lights down low<br>
            No one has to know</p>

        </p>

        <p>
            In the middle of the night, in my dreams<br>
            You should see the things we do, baby<br>
            In the middle of the night, in my dreams<br>
            I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time<br>
            Are you ready for it?</p>

        <p>
            Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me<br>
            Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry<br>
            But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and<br>
            We'll move to an island, and<br>
            And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor<br>
            Every love I've known in comparison is a failure<br>
            I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now<br>
            Never be the same now, now</p>

        <p>
            I, I, I see how this is gon' go<br>
            Touch me and you'll never be alone<br>

            Oh, are you ready for it?</p>

            I wanna be your end game<br>
            I wanna be your first string<br>
            I wanna be your A-Team (Whoa, whoa, whoa)<br>
            I wanna be your end game, end game</p>

        <p>

            Big reputation, big reputation<br>
            Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah<br>
            And you heard about me, ooh<br>
            I got some big enemies (Yeah)<br>
            Big reputation, big reputation<br>
            Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git)<br>
            And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)<br>
            You like the bad ones, too</p>



        <p>
            [Future:]
            You so dope, don't overdose, I'm so stoked, I need a toast<br>
            We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat<br>
            I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me (Yeah)<br>
            I'm one call away whenever you need me (Yeah)<br>
            I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)<br>
            I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (What they like)<br>
            You love it, I love it too 'cause you're my type (You're my type)<br>
            You hold me down and I protect you with my life</p>

        <p>
            [Taylor Swift and Future:]<br>
            I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be<br>
            Just another ex-love you don't wanna see<br>
            I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)<br>
            Like the other girls do<br>
            I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be<br>
            Drinking on a beach with you all over me<br>

        <p>
            [Ed Sheeran:]<br>
            Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older<br>
            Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders<br>
            Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep<br>
            The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me<br>
            Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long<br>
            And you understand the good and bad end up in the song<br>
            For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease<br>
            For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities<br>
            I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny<br>
            After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July<br>
            I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one<br>
            With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it</p>

        <p>
            [Taylor Swift:]<br>
            I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't<br>
            And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em<br>
            Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy<br>
            I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me<br>
            And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul<br>
            It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold<br>
            You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks<br>
            So here's the truth from my red lips<br>
        </p>

        <h1>I did Something Bad</h1>

        <p>
            I never trust a narcissist, but they love me<br>
            So I play 'em like a violin<br>
            And I make it look—oh—so easy<br>
        </p>

        <p>

            'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three<br>
            This is how the world works<br>
            Now all he thinks about is me</p>



        <p>
            I can feel the flames on my skin<br>
            Crimson-red paint on my lips<br>
            If a man talks shit<br>
            Then I owe him nothing<br>
            I don't regret it one bit<br>
            'Cause he had it coming<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            They say I did something bad<br>
            Then why's it feel so good?<br>
            They say I did something bad<br>
            But why's it feel so good?<br>
            Most fun I ever had<br>
            And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could<br>
            It just felt so good, good</p>

        <p>
            I never trust a playboy, but they love me<br>
            So I fly 'em all around the world<br>
            And I let them think they saved me<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            They never see it comin', what I do next<br>
            This is how the world works<br>
            You gotta leave before you get left<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            They say I did something bad<br>
            Then why's it feel so good?<br>
            They say I did something bad<br>
            But why's it feel so good?<br>
            Most fun I ever had<br>

            They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one<br>
            They got their pitchforks and proof, their receipts and reasons<br>
        </p>

            They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one<br>
            So light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)<br>

            Oh, you say I did something bad<br>
            (You say I did something bad?)<br>
            Why's it feel so good, good?<br>
            So bad, why's it feel so good?<br>
            Why's it feel, why's it feel so good? (bad)<br>
            It just felt so good, good<br>

            Phone lights up my nightstand in the black<br>
            Come here, you can meet me in the back<br>
            Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you<br>
            Oh damn, never seen that color blue<br>
            Just think of the fun things we could do</p>

            Is it cool that I said all that?<br>

        <p>
            Third floor on the West Side, me and you<br>
            Handsome, you're a mansion with a view<br>
            Do the girls back home touch you like I do?<br>
            Long night with your hands up in my hair<br>

        <p>I don't like your little games<br>

            The role you made me play of the fool<br>
            No, I don't like you</p>

        <p>I don't like your perfect crime<br>

            Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time<br>
            I got a list of names, and yours is in red, underlined<br>
            I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!</p>

        <p>The world moves on, another day another drama, drama<br>
            But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma<br>
            And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure<br>
            Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours</p>

            You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (mmh)<br>
            You're gorgeous</p>

        <h1>Getaway Car</h1>

        <p>No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car</p>

        <p>It was the best of times, the worst of crimes<br>
            I struck a match and blew your mind<br>
            But I didn't mean it, and you didn't see it<br>
            The ties were black, the lies were white<br>
            In shades of gray in candlelight<br>
            I wanted to leave him, I needed a reason</p>

        <p>"X" marks the spot where we fell apart<br>
            He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself<br>
            I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed<br>
            We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (oh!)</p>

        <p>You were drivin' the getaway car<br>
            We were flyin', but we'd never get far<br>
            Don't pretend it's such a mystery<br>
            Think about the place where you first met me<br>
            Ridin' in a getaway car<br>
            There were sirens in the beat of your heart<br>
            Should've known I'd be the first to leave<br>
            Think about the place where you first met me<br>
            In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh<br>
            No, they never get far, oh-oh-ah<br>
            No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car</p>

        <p>It was the great escape, the prison break<br>
            The light of freedom on my face<br>
            But you weren't thinkin' and I was just drinkin'<br>
            While he was runnin' after us, I was screamin', "Go, go, go!"<br>
            But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow<br>
            And a circus ain't a love story, and now we're both sorry (we're both sorry)</p>

        <p>"X" marks the spot where we fell apart<br>
            He poisoned the well, every man for himself<br>
            I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed<br>
            It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (oh!)</p>

        <p>You were drivin' the getaway car<br>
            We were flyin', but we'd never get far<br>
            Don't pretend it's such a mystery<br>
            Think about the place where you first met me<br>
            Ridin' in a getaway car<br>
            There were sirens in the beat of your heart<br>
            Should've known I'd be the first to leave<br>
            Think about the place where you first met me<br>
            In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh<br>
            No, they never get far, oh-oh-ah<br>
            No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car</p>

        <p>We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (oh-oh)<br>
            Until I switched to the other side, to the other side<br>
            It's no surprise I turned you in (oh-oh)<br>
            'Cause us traitors never win</p>

        <p>I'm in a getaway car<br>
            I left you in a motel bar<br>
            Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys<br>
            That was the last time you ever saw me (oh!)</p>

        <p>Drivin' the getaway car<br>
            We were flyin', but we'd never get far (don't pretend)<br>
            Don't pretend it's such a mystery<br>
            Think about the place where you first met me<br>
            Ridin' in a getaway car<br>
            There were sirens in the beat of your heart (should've known)<br>
            Should've known I'd be the first to leave<br>
            Think about the place where you first met me<br>
            In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh<br>
            No, they never get far, oh-oh-ah<br>
            No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car</p>

        <p>I was ridin' in a getaway car<br>
            I was cryin' in a getaway car<br>
            I was dyin' in a getaway car<br>
            Said goodbye in a getaway car<br>
            Ridin' in a getaway car<br>
            I was cryin' in a getaway car<br>
            I was dyin' in a getaway car<br>
            Said goodbye in a getaway car</p>

        <p>I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own<br>
            I made up my mind, I'm better off bein' alone<br>
            We met a few weeks ago<br>
            Now you try on callin' me, baby, like tryin' on clothes</p>

        <p>Salute to me, I'm your American Queen<br>
            And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat<br>
            And we rule the kingdom inside my room<br>
            'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars<br>
            With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars<br>
            Never took me quite where you do</p>

        <p>And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for<br>
            King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa<br>
            And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go<br>

        <p>Late in the night, the city's asleep<br>
            Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep<br>
            Change my priorities<br>
            The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury</p>

        <p>Salute to me, I'm your American Queen<br>
            And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat<br>
            And we rule the kingdom inside my room (inside my room, oh)<br>
            'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars<br>

            Never took me quite where you do (where you do)</p>

        <p>Is this the end of all the endings?<br>
            My broken bones are mending<br>
            With all these nights we're spending<br>
            Up on the roof with a school girl crush<br>
            Drinking beer out of plastic cups<br>
            Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff<br>
            Baby, all at once, this is enough</p>

        <p>And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for<br>

        <h1>Dancing With Our Hands Tied</h1>

        <p>I, I loved you in secret<br>
            First sight, yeah, we love without reason<br>
            Oh, twenty-five years old<br>
            Oh, how were you to know, and<br>
            My, my love had been frozen<br>
            Deep blue, but you painted me golden<br>
            Oh, and you held me close<br>
            Oh, how was I to know that</p>

        <p>I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets<br>
            Picture of your face in an invisible locket<br>
            You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it<br>
            I had a bad feeling<br>
            And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis<br>
            People started talking, putting us through our paces<br>
            I knew there was no one in the world who could take it<br>
            I had a bad feeling</p>

        <p>But we were dancing<br>
            Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied<br>
            Yeah, we were dancing<br>
            Like it was the first time, first time<br>
            Yeah, we were dancing<br>
            Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied<br>
            Yeah, we were dancing<br>
            And I had a bad feeling<br>
            But we were dancing</p>

        <p>I, I loved you in spite of<br>
            Deep fears that the world would divide us<br>
            So, baby, can we dance<br>
            Oh, through an avalanche?<br>
            And say, say that we got it<br>
            I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted<br>
            Oh, 'cause it's gravity<br>
            Oh, keeping you with me</p>

        <p>I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets<br>

            And I had a bad feeling<br>
            But we were dancing</p>

        <p>I'd kiss you as the lights went out<br>
            Swaying as the room burned down<br>
            I'd hold you as the water rushes in<br>
            If I could dance with you again<br>
            I'd kiss you as the lights went out<br>
            Swaying as the room burned down<br>

        <p>Our secret moments in your crowded room<br>
            They got no idea about me and you<br>
            There is an indentation in the shape of you<br>
            Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo</p>

        <p>All of this silence and patience, pining in anticipation<br>
            My hands are shaking from holding back from you (ah, ah, ah)<br>
            All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting<br>
            My hands are shaking from all this (ah, ha, ha, ha)</p>

        <p>Say my name and everything just stops<br>
            I don't want you like a best friend<br>
            Only bought this dress so you could take it off<br>
            Take it off<br>

        <p>Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try<br>
            And if I get burned, at least we were electrified<br>
            I'm spilling wine in the bathtub<br>
            You kiss my face and we're both drunk<br>
            Everyone thinks that they know us<br>
            But they know nothing about</p>

            Flashback to my mistakes<br>
            My rebounds, my earthquakes<br>
            Even in my worst lies<br>

        <h1>This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things</h1>

        <p>It was so nice throwin' big parties<br>
            Jump into the pool from the balcony<br>
            Everyone swimmin' in a champagne sea</p>

        <p>And there are no rules when you show up here<br>
            Bass beat rattling the chandelier<br>
            Feelin' so Gatsby for that whole year</p>

        <p>So why'd you have to rain on my parade?<br>
            I'm shaking my head and locking the gates</p>

        <p>This is why we can't have nice things, darlin'<br>
            Because you break them, I had to take them away<br>
            This is why we can't have nice things, honey (oh)<br>
            Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?<br>
            This is why we can't have nice things</p>

        <p>It was so nice being friends again<br>
            There I was, giving you a second chance<br>
            But you stabbed me in the back while shakin' my hand</p>

        <p>And therein lies the issue, friends don't try to trick you<br>
            Get you on the phone and mind-twist you<br>
            And so I took an axe to a mended fence</p>

        <p>But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (mm)<br>
            If only you weren't so shady</p>

        <p>This is why we can't have nice things, darlin' (yeah)<br>
            Because you break them, I had to take them away<br>
            This is why we can't have nice (nice things) things (baby), honey (oh)<br>
            Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?<br>
            This is why we can't have-</p>

        <p>Here's a toast to my real friends<br>
            They don't care about the "he said, she said"<br>
            And here's to my baby<br>
            He ain't readin' what they call me lately</p>

        <p>And here's to my mama<br>
            Had to listen to all this drama<br>
            And here's to you<br>
            'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do<br>
            Hahaha, I can't even say it with a straight face</p>

        <p>This is why we can't have nice things, darlin' (darlin')<br>
            Because you break them, I had to take them away<br>
            This is why we can't have nice (uh, uh) things (oh, no), honey (baby) (oh)<br>
            Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?</p>

        <p>This is why we can't have (oh) nice things (oh, no), darlin' (and here's to my real friends)<br>
            (Oh) because you break them, I had to take them, and here's to my baby<br>
            (Oh) nice things (oh, no), honey (they didn't care about that "he said, she said")<br>

            Walkin' with his head down, I'm the one he's walkin' to<br>
            So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to<br>
            My baby's fly like a jet stream<br>
            High above the whole scene, loves me like I'm brand new<br>
            So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to</p>

        <p>All my flowers grew back as thorns<br>
            Windows boarded up after the storm<br>
            He built a fire just to keep me warm<br>
            All the drama queens taking swings<br>
            All the jokers dressin' up as kings<br>
            They fade to nothin' when I look at him</p>

        <p>And I know I make the same mistakes every time<br>
            Bridges burn, I never learn, at least I did one thing right<br>
            I did one thing right<br>
            I'm laughin' with my lover, makin' forts under covers<br>
            Trust him like a brother, yeah, you know I did one thing right<br>
            Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night</p>

        <p>My baby's fit like a daydream<br>
            Walkin' with his head down, I'm the one he's walkin' to<br>
            So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to<br>
            My baby's fly like a jet stream<br>
            High above the whole scene, loves me like I'm brand new<br>
            (Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)<br>
            So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to</p>

        <p>I want to wear his initial<br>
            On a chain 'round my neck, chain 'round my neck<br>
            Not because he owns me<br>
            But 'cause he really knows me<br>
            Which is more than they can say, I<br>
            I recall late November<br>
            Holdin' my breath, slowly I said<br>
            "You don't need to save me<br>
            But would you run away with me?"<br>
            Yes (would you run away?)</p>

        <p>My baby's fit like a daydream<br>
            Walkin' with his head down, I'm the one he's walkin' to<br>
            (Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)<br>
            So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to<br>
            My baby's fly like a jet stream<br>
            High above the whole scene, loves me like I'm brand new<br>
            (Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)<br>
            So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to</p>

        <p>Call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want<br>
            To</p>

        <h1>New Year's Day</h1>

        <p>There's glitter on the floor after the party<br>
            Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby<br>
            Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor<br>
            You and me from the night before, but</p>

        <p>Don't read the last page<br>
            But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared, and you're turning away<br>
            I want your midnights<br>
            But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day</p>

        <p>You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi<br>
            I can tell that it's gonna be a long road<br>
            I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe<br>
            Or if you strike out and you're crawling home</p>

        <p>Don't read the last page<br>
            But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong, or we're making mistakes<br>
            I want your midnights<br>
            But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day</p>

        <p>Hold on to the memories<br>
            They will hold on to you<br>
            Hold on to the memories<br>
            They will hold on to you<br>
            Hold on to the memories<br>
            They will hold on to you<br>
            And I will hold on to you</p>

        <p>Please don't ever become a stranger<br>
            Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere<br>
            Please don't ever become a stranger<br>
            Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere</p>
